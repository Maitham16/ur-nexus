UR-Nexus is a Bun and TypeScript autonomous engineering workflow engine: a
reproducible autonomous software engineering agent built for disciplined local
and CI-driven work. It is not only chat, autocomplete, or code edits: UR is
built to plan, execute, test, verify, document, benchmark, and reproduce
software work. It opens a stateful interactive terminal session by default, can
run one-shot prompts for scripts, and includes workflow commands for
specification-driven development,
multi-agent execution, test-first quality loops, CI repair loops, background
agents, MCP servers, plugins, skills, memory, permission safety policy,
project context packing, verification, and local model routing.

UR-Nexus integrates official model access paths only: subscription CLIs,
explicit API-key mode, and local OpenAI-compatible runtimes. It never scrapes
browser sessions, extracts OAuth tokens, or bypasses provider restrictions.

## Why UR

UR is built around the work that happens after a prompt: reading a repository,
editing files, running commands, validating the result, preserving context, and
handing work off to other tools or agents when needed.

- **Reproducible engineering loop.** Substantial tasks should move through
  `spec -> plan -> patch -> test -> report -> rollback`, with command evidence
  captured before success is claimed.
- **Terminal-native agent loop.** Run `ur` for an interactive coding session or
  `ur -p` for automation-friendly output.
- **Local model runtime.** Use any model exposed by Ollama, set a specific host
  with `--ollama-host`, or discover LAN Ollama servers with `--discover-ollama`.
- **Legal provider routing.** Use `ur provider`, `ur auth chatgpt`,
  `ur auth claude`, `ur auth gemini`, `ur auth antigravity`, and safe
  `ur config set ...` commands to select official subscription, API, or local
  providers without storing secrets in UR settings.
- **Agent workflows.** Use `ur spec`, `ur arena`, `ur test-first`,
  `ur ci-loop`, `ur bg`, `ur workflow`, `ur crew`, and `ur automation` for
  structured work beyond a single chat turn.
- **Reliable repo editing.** Use `ur repo-edit` for indexed search,
  AST-aware rename plans, patch previews, and rollback-safe multi-file apply.
- **Permission and context control.** Use `ur safety` and `ur context-pack` to
  inspect command risk, initialize project safety policy, summarize repository
  architecture, and preserve task decisions, constraints, commands, diffs,
  architecture decisions, preferred commands, failed attempts, accepted patterns,
  and rejected approaches.
- **Lifecycle hooks.** Configure `BeforeEdit`, `AfterEdit`, `BeforeCommand`,
  `AfterCommand`, `BeforeCommit`, and `OnFailure` hooks in `.ur/hooks.json` or
  `UR.md` to run custom commands when the agent edits files, runs shell commands,
  commits, or hits a failure.
- **Verification and provenance.** Use `ur test-first`, the built-in verifier,
  `/verify`, `.ur/verify.json`, `ur artifacts`, `ur claim-ledger`, and `/trace`
  to make results easier to inspect.
- **Extensible tool surface.** Add MCP tools, plugin marketplace entries,
  executable skills, reusable templates, deterministic validators, language
  adapters, LSP servers, role modes, custom agents, IDE diff bundles, A2A
  endpoints, and local knowledge indexes.

## Prompt Planning and Task Board

UR-Nexus decomposes `ur exec` prompts into executable task units before work
starts. Short prompts stay compact. Longer prompts are split into ordered small
tasks only when the wording, dependencies, or file targets make separate tasks
useful. Each task records id, order, title, description, status, dependencies,
assigned logical agent role, input, expected output, verification criteria, file
targets, risk level, and whether approval is required.

During real `ur exec` runs the task board streams when a task status changes,
then appears again in the final report. Quiet/non-interactive runs can suppress
streaming while preserving the final board. Public status labels are
action-oriented: queued, running, waiting approval, needs scope, needs context,
paused for review, skipped by policy, finished, and failed.

```text
[UR-Nexus Task Board]
Agents: 1 active / 3 max

1. queued           | executor | Update CLI branding
2. running          | executor | Update README references
3. waiting approval | verifier | Validate release archive

Progress: 0/3 finished, 1 running, 1 queued, 1 waiting, 0 failed, 0 skipped
```

Before a task runs, UR-Nexus checks that required files/resources exist and
that assumptions are explicit. Risky actions require explicit approval first:
destructive commands, outside-workspace writes/deletes, network or external
system actions, credential-sensitive access, exploit-like commands, and security
testing. The approval request records the action, reason, command or path when
available, and the approval decision in task evidence. Security-research prompts
need scoped targets and authorization confirmation; local/lab/test targets are
preferred unless the user confirms authorized external scope.

Outside-workspace reads are allowed when requested or clearly required, and the
outside path is recorded in the task board/evidence. Modifying or deleting
outside-workspace files requires approval before execution.

After a task runs, verification compares the executor's claims with evidence
from workspace snapshots and observed command records. Strict verification
rejects unsupported file-change and command claims; non-strict verification
records them as warnings. Independent tasks can run through adaptive parallel
logical workers: simple prompts use one agent, medium prompts use two or three
when useful, and large independent graphs can use up to `maxAgents`. Tasks that
depend on another task or target the same file are serialized.

At the end of execution, `ur exec` reports task counts, the final ordered task
board, active/max agents used, finished/waiting/failed/skipped tasks, actual
changed files, outside-workspace files accessed or modified, verified commands,
unverified command claims, approval decisions, verification failures, warnings,
and remaining limitations. Command tracking is limited to commands surfaced by
the task runner; provider-internal or detached activity is reported as
unverified unless the executor exposes it as observed evidence. Use
`--no-task-planning` to keep the legacy direct prompt execution path for a run.

Planning defaults are safe and can be configured with:

```json
{
  "taskPlanning": true,
  "parallelAgents": true,
  "maxAgents": 3,
  "showTaskBoard": true,
  "strictVerification": true
}
```

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Bun `>=1.3.0` (this repository pins `bun@1.3.14`). Bun is mandatory: every
  install path — npm, GitHub, or source checkout — runs the CLI through Bun,
  not Node. UR-Nexus is not Node-native.
- Node.js `>=18.18` only to start the npm-installed launcher script
  (`bin/ur.js`), which immediately checks for Bun and re-execs into it. If Bun
  is missing, the launcher errors out instead of falling back to Node.
- `sharp` installs automatically as a native runtime dependency (image
  resizing for file reads, pasted images, and multimodal provider input).
- For the default local setup: a running Ollama app or server
  (`http://localhost:11434/api`). Any other supported provider (API key,
  OpenAI-compatible server, or subscription CLI) works without Ollama.
- Optional tools for specific workflows: GitHub CLI, tmux, and supported IDE
  integrations.

### Install

Remove old global installs first if needed:

```sh
npm uninstall -g ur-agent
bun remove -g ur-agent
```

Install the global `ur` command:

```sh
npm install -g ur-agent
ur --version
ur --help
```

Install directly from GitHub when you want this repository build:

```sh
bun add -g github:Maitham16/UR
ur --version
```

### Start A Session

```sh
ur
```

Run one prompt and exit:

```sh
ur -p "summarize this repository"
```

Return structured output for scripts:

```sh
ur -p --output-format json "list the main services in this codebase"
```

Resume previous work:

```sh
ur --continue
ur --resume
```

Check for npm updates:

```sh
ur upgrade
```

Source checkouts report:

```text
Development build detected. To update, pull latest source or install from npm.
```

Choose a model or Ollama host:

```sh
ur --model qwen3-coder:480b-cloud
ur --ollama-host http://192.168.1.50:11434
ur --discover-ollama
```

For Ollama sessions, model selection precedence is `OLLAMA_MODEL`, then
`UR_MODEL`, then the model router over the configured Ollama host. Once a
provider/model pair is selected with `/model` or `ur config set`, runtime
requests use that provider backend; they do not fall back to Ollama unless
`ollama` is the selected provider.

### Legal Provider Auth

UR-Nexus stores only safe provider preferences: provider name, model name,
base URL, fallback preference, and non-secret settings. API keys must stay in
environment variables. API, local, and OpenAI-compatible server providers are
UR-native runtimes and behave like Ollama: UR owns the conversation loop, tool
loop, errors, and output.

The provider list shows the subscription CLIs (Codex CLI, Claude Code, Gemini
CLI, Antigravity) alongside the API and local/server providers, and they are
first-class: pick one in `/model` and it dispatches through the official CLI.
These are external app bridges — they run the vendor's own CLI using your
subscription — so you log in with `ur auth <provider>` (e.g. `ur auth chatgpt`,
`ur auth claude`). UR does not invent subscription models; each subscription
shows its curated model list. The generic `subscription` entry is an internal
placeholder and is hidden from the list.

```sh
ur provider list
ur provider status
ur provider doctor
ur provider models [provider] --json
ur config set provider ollama
ur config set provider openai-api
ur config set provider anthropic-api
ur config set provider gemini-api
ur config set provider openrouter
ur config set model qwen3-coder:480b-cloud
ur provider select-model ollama qwen3-coder:480b-cloud --json
ur config set base_url http://localhost:11434
ur config set provider.fallback ollama
```

Provider config accepts canonical IDs and common aliases. Examples:
`openai-api`, `anthropic-api`, `gemini-api`, `openrouter`, `ollama`,
`lmstudio`, `LM Studio`, `llama.cpp`, `vllm`, and the subscription CLIs
`codex-cli` (`chatgpt`), `claude-code-cli` (`claude`), `gemini-cli` (`gemini`),
and `antigravity-cli` (`agy`). Use quotes for shell values with spaces.

Connect accounts once with `ur connect` (or `/connect` in a session):

```sh
ur connect status                     # connection state for every provider
ur connect codex-cli                  # subscription: launches the official login
echo "$OPENAI_API_KEY" | ur connect openai-api   # API: store a key in the OS keychain
ur connect logout openai-api          # clear a stored key
```

| Provider | Access type | Runtime kind | Legal path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI API | API key | UR-native | `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ur connect openai-api` |
| Claude API | API key | UR-native | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `ur connect anthropic-api` |
| Gemini API | API key | UR-native | `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `ur connect gemini-api` |
| OpenRouter | API/router | UR-native | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `ur connect openrouter` |
| Ollama | local | UR-native | localhost Ollama runtime |
| LM Studio | local/server | UR-native | local OpenAI-compatible server |
| llama.cpp | local/server | UR-native | local OpenAI-compatible server |
| vLLM | local/server | UR-native | OpenAI-compatible server |
| Codex CLI | subscription | external app bridge | official Codex CLI login (`ur auth chatgpt`) |
| Claude Code | subscription | external app bridge | official Claude Code login (`ur auth claude`) |
| Gemini CLI | subscription | external app bridge | official Gemini Code Assist login (`ur auth gemini`) |
| Antigravity | subscription | external app bridge | official Antigravity CLI login (`ur auth antigravity`) |

#### Provider-first model selection

In the interactive app, `/model` is a two-step, provider-first picker:

1. **Choose a provider.** Every provider is listed with its display name,
   internal ID, access type (`subscription`, `api`, `local`, `server`),
   credential type, and a live connection status (`connected`, `missing`,
   `unavailable`, `unknown`).
2. **Choose a model.** Only the selected provider's models are shown, labelled
   by source: `live` (discovered from the endpoint), `cache` (last discovery),
   or `static` (predefined). Local/server providers (Ollama, LM Studio,
   llama.cpp, vLLM) and OpenAI-compatible endpoints are discovered live; API
   providers use live discovery from their `/models` endpoint once a key is
   connected (with a curated fallback list before that). Subscription CLIs show
   their curated model list because the official CLIs expose no models API. The
   generic `subscription` entry is an internal placeholder hidden from listings.

Model lists never cross providers: OpenAI API, Claude API, Gemini API,
OpenRouter, Ollama, and OpenAI-compatible local/server endpoints are separate
access paths. API keys, local runtimes, and subscription logins are not
interchangeable. The provider/model pair is validated before it is saved and
again before every request; changing provider clears an incompatible model.
`ur config set provider X` warns and clears an incompatible model, and
`ur config set model Y` is validated against the active provider. The
confirmation shows the selected provider, model, model source, and the runtime
backend that will receive the next request.

#### Runtime dispatch

The selected provider/model drives every agent request — the assistant's own
identity line in the system prompt reflects it too:

- **API** providers call each service in its native wire format — Anthropic
  `x-api-key` + `anthropic-version` on `/v1/messages`, OpenAI `Bearer` on
  `/v1/chat/completions`, Gemini `x-goog-api-key` on `:generateContent`,
  OpenRouter on its OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint.
- **Local/server** providers call the configured endpoint (`/v1/chat/completions`
  for LM Studio/llama.cpp/vLLM; the native API for Ollama).
- **Subscription CLIs** (Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, Antigravity) are external
  app bridges: selecting one dispatches the turn through the vendor's official
  CLI using your subscription. Log in with `ur auth <provider>`. UR-native
  tool calling, UR-native streaming, UR Bash/File tool execution, and sandbox
  guarantees apply to UR-run tools and final UR output — not to what the
  external CLI does internally (see Provider Guide below).
- **Subscription** access does not list fake models. If no independent
  subscription backend is configured, `/model` marks it unavailable and asks you
  to choose a connected local, server, or API provider.

Ollama is used only when Ollama is selected. There is no silent cross-provider
fallback: if dispatch fails, UR reports the selected provider, model, and runtime
backend. Use `ur provider status` (or `ur provider doctor <id>`) to inspect the
active provider, model, access type, and backend.

Security policy: UR-Nexus never scrapes browser sessions, extracts OAuth
tokens, bypasses subscription/quota/region/organization restrictions, proxies a
consumer web session as an API, or claims support for a provider unless the
official CLI/API path works. See [Provider Guide](docs/providers.md).

### Status Bar

Interactive sessions show a compact bottom status bar when the terminal supports
it. It is hidden in CI, dumb terminals, non-interactive mode, and assistant
viewer mode.

Example:

```text
Ollama | llama3 | ask | main
```

The bar reflects the active in-session provider/model immediately after a
`/model`, `/model <model>`, or `/provider` change — it does not wait for
persisted settings to reload. If a custom status-line hook is configured,
UR-Nexus uses that hook output instead of the built-in bar.

### IDE Integration

The professional UR IDE integration is the **UR Inline Diffs** VS Code
extension: a chat panel, inline diff review, an actions panel, an agent
status card, a searchable command palette, and an agent options panel for VS
Code, Cursor, and Windsurf. It is bundled inside this repository and
packaged as a local VSIX when installed from UR-Nexus; the public install
path does not depend on an unpublished marketplace extension ID. The
extension never talks to a model provider or network service directly —
every AI request goes through your local `ur` CLI, same as in a terminal.

`ur ide diff` captures review bundles under `.ur/ide/diffs/` so editors can
show agent diffs without scraping terminal output:

```sh
ur ide diff capture --title "Parser fix"
ur ide diff list
ur ide diff show <id>
```

In the **Inline Diffs** / **Actions** views you can preview a bundle,
**Apply** it (a confirmed `git apply`, recorded through `ur ide diff
approve` — never a silent write or an out-of-vocabulary status), **Reject**
it, or run **UR: Agent Status**. Chat, editor actions (Explain/Fix/Generate
Tests), diff review, and the verifier all route through the same CLI
contract — see the [IDE Guide](docs/IDE.md) for the full feature list.

Inspect and configure integration per editor:

```sh
ur ide status               # workspace, ACP server, provider/model, sandbox/verifier mode, plugin count
ur ide doctor               # pass/warn/fail checks; reports missing config clearly
ur ide config zed           # print the .zed/settings.json ACP block
ur ide config vscode        # VS Code / Cursor / Windsurf setup
```

VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf connect through the UR Inline Diffs extension;
Zed and ACP-capable Neovim clients connect through the stdio Agent Client
Protocol. **JetBrains is not implemented in this repository** — no plugin
ships from here; only detection code for a future one exists. Start an ACP
surface with:

```sh
ur acp stdio                        # stdio ACP agent for editors (Zed, Neovim)
ur acp serve --port 8123 [--debug]  # HTTP JSON-RPC server for scripts/clients (not the VS Code chat transport)
ur acp status
```

See the [IDE Guide](docs/IDE.md) and [ACP Guide](docs/ACP.md) for per-editor
setup, supported features, and limitations.

New slash skills run agentic work in isolated git worktrees with clean commits and PR output:
`/debug-v2`, `/refactor`, `/paper-implementation`, `/benchmark`, `/security-review`, `/dockerize`, `/latex-paper`.
Install matching agent templates with `ur agent-templates install`.

New built-in tools (exposed through MCP and the ACP server): GitHub, API, Browser, Docker, TestRunner, Database. File-system and terminal tools are already built in (FileRead, FileEdit, FileWrite, Glob, Grep, Bash, PowerShell).

### Plugin Marketplace

UR plugins are trusted local extension bundles. A marketplace entry can install
commands, MCP tools, executable skills, reusable templates, deterministic
validators, language adapters, LSP server metadata, agents, hooks, and output
styles. The bundled `engineering-discipline` reference plugin demonstrates the
full extension contract with a `/discipline-check` command, a
`reproducible-release` skill, a release-verifier template, a release-gate
validator, and Markdown language-adapter metadata.

```sh
ur plugin list
ur plugin doctor
ur plugin install engineering-discipline@ur-plugins-official
ur plugin install hello@ur-plugins-official
ur plugin update <plugin>
ur plugin disable <plugin>
```

`ur plugin doctor` validates every installed, project, and bundled plugin
manifest and reports its declared components and capability surface, so you can
review what a plugin touches before enabling it.

The npm package includes `README.md`, `QUALITY.md`, `docs/`, `documentation/`,
and `plugins/`, so the npm package page and installed artifact both carry the
marketplace documentation, core plugins, community staging directory, and
example plugin template. See [Plugin Guide](docs/plugins.md).

UR also documents the core Cursor-style agent primitives as first-class,
project-backed features: Agent surfaces (`ur`, `ur agents`, `ur crew`, `ur bg`),
Rules (`AGENTS.md`, `UR.md`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.cursorrules`, safety and
guardrail config), MCP (`ur mcp`, `.mcp.json`, plugin MCP servers), Skills
(`/skills`, bundled, project, user, and plugin skills), CLI (`ur --help`, `ur -p`,
`ur exec`, `ur acp`), and Models (`/model`, `ur config set model`,
`ur model-doctor`, Ollama routing and discovery).

Examples:

```sh
ur spec init checkout --goal "1. add cart 2. add payment 3. add receipt"
ur spec run checkout --all --dry-run
ur spec run checkout --all --kernel
ur spec verify checkout --kernel
ur crew create parser-crew --goal "fix the flaky parser test" --decompose --dry-run

## Project Context

UR reads repository instructions and local runtime state from project files:

- `AGENTS.md` and `UR.md` provide shared project instructions.
- `UR.local.md` is for private local instructions.
- `.ur/skills/` stores project skills.
- `.ur/agents/` stores custom agents and role modes.
- `.ur/safety-policy.json` configures project shell safety rules for read,
  write, execute, and network command classes.
- `.ur/project-manifest.json` and `.ur/context/` hold architecture summaries,
  task memory, compressed context, and project memory including architecture
  decisions, preferred commands, failed attempts, accepted patterns, and rejected
  approaches.
- `.ur/specs/`, `.ur/artifacts/`, `.ur/automations/`, `.ur/test-first/`,
  `.ur/memory/`, and `.ur/index/` hold workflow state, review artifacts,
  scheduled jobs, failure traces, memory, and indexes.

Commit only shared project assets that are safe for teammates. Keep local
settings, generated indexes, memory, logs, and secrets out of Git.

## Architecture

- `bin/ur.js` is the global launcher, invoked via Node's shebang. It always
  executes the CLI through Bun — `bun dist/cli.js` when the bundle is present,
  otherwise `bun run` against the TypeScript entrypoint — and exits with an
  install error if Bun is not found. Node never runs the CLI itself.
- `src/entrypoints/cli.tsx` handles fast startup paths such as `--version`,
  A2A serving, background sessions, bridge mode, and daemon paths before loading
  the full CLI.
- `src/main.tsx` defines the top-level flags and subcommands.
- `src/commands.ts` and `src/commands/` register slash commands and local CLI
  command modules.
- `src/tools/` contains tool implementations for file editing, shell execution,
  MCP resources, task management, and agent delegation.
- `src/services/` contains runtime services for MCP, verification, memory,
  code indexing, safety policy, context manifests, model routing, background
  agents, A2A, analytics, sync, and API integration.
- `extensions/vscode-ur-inline-diffs/` contains the professional VS Code IDE
  extension (chat, streaming, inline diff review, actions panel, status
  card, search, and agent options) for VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf.
- `plugins/core/` contains first-party marketplace plugins.
- `plugins/community/` stages contributed plugins.
- `plugins/examples/` contains plugin templates users can copy.

## Safety Model

UR can read files, edit code, execute commands, and call configured tools, so
the permission boundary matters.

- Sensitive tool actions go through permission checks by default.
- `--allowed-tools` and `--disallowed-tools` can scope tool access for
  automation.
- `permissions.defaultMode: "autoApprove"` auto-approves operations that would
  otherwise pause for permission approval, while user-input dialogs still ask.
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` should only be used inside disposable
  sandboxes.
- The verifier checks for false completion claims, repeated tool-call loops,
  empty assistant turns, and project gates.
- Project gates can be configured in `.ur/verify.json`.
- `ur test-first install` writes detected compile/test/lint commands into
  `.ur/verify.json` so mutating turns have command evidence before completion.
- `ur safety check --command "<cmd>"` classifies read, write, execute, and
  network permissions, asks before destructive commands, recommends sandboxing
  for risky operations, and blocks common secret exfiltration paths.
- `ur safety init` writes `.ur/safety-policy.json` for project-specific safety
  rules.
- `ur context-pack scan` writes a repo architecture manifest from package
  scripts, instruction files, `.ur/verify.json`, and safety config.
- The deep verification subagent is available through `/verify` and can be
  auto-enabled with `UR_VERIFIER_AUTO_SUBAGENT=1`.
- UR enforces permission and sandbox policy before running UR Bash/File
  tools, not after. Sandbox mode is `disabled` (default), `recommended`
  (`sandbox.enabled: true`, best-effort), or `required`
  (`sandbox.enabled: true` + `sandbox.failIfUnavailable: true`) — `required`
  fails closed and refuses to start if OS sandbox support is unavailable.
  OS confinement uses `sandbox-exec` (Seatbelt) on macOS or `bwrap`
  (bubblewrap) on Linux/WSL2; see `ur sandbox status`.
- This sandbox wraps UR-run Bash/File tool commands only. It does not extend
  to actions a subscription CLI provider performs internally — see
  [Provider Guide](docs/providers.md).
- MCP servers can access external services; only enable servers you trust.

See [Configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md), [Validation](docs/VALIDATION.md),
and [Quality Notes](QUALITY.md) for operational guidance.

## Troubleshooting

Common problems — `ur` not found after install, a provider that is selected
but not connected, a model that belongs to another provider, unreachable local
servers, plugin or editor connection issues — are covered with symptom, cause,
fix, and a verification command in the
[Troubleshooting Guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md). Start with:

```sh
ur --version
ur provider status
ur provider doctor
```

## Development

Install dependencies:

```sh
bun install
```

Run from source:

```sh
bun run start
bun run dev
```

Build and verify a release:

```sh
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun test
bun run build
bun run smoke
bun run secrets:scan
bun run release:check
bun run package:check
npm pack --dry-run
npm publish --dry-run
```

`dist/cli.js` is intentionally tracked because GitHub installs use the bundled
CLI. Rebuild it after source, version, or macro changes.

The GitHub workflow runs production bundle, smoke, release, package, and global
install checks only after the Bun test step succeeds. Do not publish or tag a
release until that GitHub run is green.

## Package

- npm package: [`ur-agent`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ur-agent), binary `ur`.
- The package name remains `ur-agent` for compatibility with existing installs
  and legacy `ur-agent` configs. User-facing branding is `UR-Nexus`; the global
  command remains `ur`. A future package rename would use `ur-nexus`.
- The published package ships the bundled CLI (`dist/cli.js`), launcher
  (`bin/ur.js`), documentation (`docs/`, `documentation/`, `examples/`), and
  first-party plugins (`plugins/`, `.ur-plugin` marketplace manifest is part of
  the repository).
- Releases follow the [Release Runbook](RELEASE.md); every release is recorded
  in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
