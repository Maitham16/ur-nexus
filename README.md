UR Agent is a Bun and TypeScript command-line coding agent. It opens a stateful
interactive terminal session by default, can run one-shot prompts for scripts,
and includes workflow commands for specification-driven development,
multi-agent execution, test-first quality loops, CI repair loops, background
agents, MCP servers, plugins, skills, memory, verification, and local model
routing.

UR sends model requests through the configured local Ollama app. That app can
serve local models or Ollama Cloud-backed models, while UR itself stays out of
provider API key management.

## Why UR

UR is built around the work that happens after a prompt: reading a repository,
editing files, running commands, validating the result, preserving context, and
handing work off to other tools or agents when needed.

- **Terminal-native agent loop.** Run `ur` for an interactive coding session or
  `ur -p` for automation-friendly output.
- **Local model runtime.** Use any model exposed by Ollama, set a specific host
  with `--ollama-host`, or discover LAN Ollama servers with `--discover-ollama`.
- **Agent workflows.** Use `ur spec`, `ur arena`, `ur test-first`,
  `ur ci-loop`, `ur bg`, `ur workflow`, `ur crew`, and `ur automation` for
  structured work beyond a single chat turn.
- **Reliable repo editing.** Use `ur repo-edit` for indexed search,
  AST-aware rename plans, patch previews, and rollback-safe multi-file apply.
- **Verification and provenance.** Use `ur test-first`, the built-in verifier,
  `/verify`, `.ur/verify.json`, `ur artifacts`, `ur claim-ledger`, and `/trace`
  to make results easier to inspect.
- **Extensible tool surface.** Add MCP servers, plugins, skills, role modes,
  custom agents, IDE diff bundles, A2A endpoints, and local knowledge indexes.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Bun. This repository is configured with `bun@1.3.14`.
- A Node.js-compatible shell environment.
- A running Ollama app or server. UR defaults to `http://localhost:11434/api`.
- Optional tools for specific workflows: GitHub CLI, tmux, and supported IDE
  integrations.

### Install

Remove old global installs first if needed:

```sh
npm uninstall -g ur-agent
bun remove -g ur-agent
```

Install the global `ur` command:

```sh
npm install -g ur-agent
ur --version
```

Install directly from GitHub when you want this repository build:

```sh
bun add -g github:Maitham16/UR-mapek
ur --version
```

### Start A Session

```sh
ur
```

Run one prompt and exit:

```sh
ur -p "summarize this repository"
```

Return structured output for scripts:

```sh
ur -p --output-format json "list the main services in this codebase"
```

Resume previous work:

```sh
ur --continue
ur --resume
```

Choose a model or Ollama host:

```sh
ur --model qwen3-coder:480b-cloud
ur --ollama-host http://192.168.1.50:11434
ur --discover-ollama
```

Model selection precedence is `OLLAMA_MODEL`, then `UR_MODEL`, then the model
router over the configured Ollama host. If model discovery fails, the built-in
fallback is `qwen3-coder:480b-cloud`.

## Command Surface

Run `ur --help` for the complete CLI reference. These commands are implemented
as first-class subcommands in the shipped CLI.

| Command | Purpose |

| `ur -p` | Run a non-interactive prompt with text, JSON, or stream-JSON output. |
| `ur spec` | Create requirements, design, and task documents under `.ur/specs/`, then run the task list. |
| `ur escalate` | Plan or run work with fast and oracle model tiers selected from local model capabilities. |
| `ur arena` | Run multiple agents on the same task in isolated worktrees and surface the winning diff. |
| `ur ci-loop` | Run a build or test command, hand failures to a fix agent, and retry with a bounded budget. |

| `ur code-index` | Build, query, or watch a local semantic code index using Ollama embeddings. |
| `ur semantic-memory` | Build and search a project-local memory index. |
| `ur knowledge` | Manage a curated project knowledge base with provenance. |
| `ur artifacts` | Capture diffs, test runs, notes, and review feedback under `.ur/artifacts/`. |
| `ur claim-ledger` | Map generated claims to file, web, MCP, tool, or user sources. |
| `ur browser-qa` | Validate and smoke-run browser QA replay fixtures. |
| `ur eval bench` | Import local SWE-bench, Terminal-Bench, or Aider Polyglot exports. |
| `ur model-doctor` | Inspect Ollama models and report likely agent capabilities. |
| `ur model-route` | Recommend a local model for a task by capability fit. |
| `ur mcp` | Configure and manage Model Context Protocol servers. |
| `ur plugin` | Install, update, enable, disable, and validate UR plugins. |
| `ur role-mode` | Install built-in Architect, Code, Debug, and Ask role modes. |

```

## Project Context

UR reads repository instructions and local runtime state from project files:

- `AGENTS.md` and `UR.md` provide shared project instructions.
- `UR.local.md` is for private local instructions.
- `.ur/skills/` stores project skills.
- `.ur/agents/` stores custom agents and role modes.
- `.ur/specs/`, `.ur/artifacts/`, `.ur/automations/`, `.ur/test-first/`,
  `.ur/memory/`, and `.ur/index/` hold workflow state, review artifacts,
  scheduled jobs, failure traces, memory, and indexes.

Commit only shared project assets that are safe for teammates. Keep local
settings, generated indexes, memory, logs, and secrets out of Git.

## Architecture

- `bin/ur.js` is the global launcher. It reads package metadata, uses the
  bundled `dist/cli.js` when available, and otherwise starts the TypeScript CLI
  through Bun.
- `src/entrypoints/cli.tsx` handles fast startup paths such as `--version`,
  A2A serving, background sessions, bridge mode, and daemon paths before loading
  the full CLI.
- `src/main.tsx` defines the top-level flags and subcommands.
- `src/commands.ts` and `src/commands/` register slash commands and local CLI
  command modules.
- `src/tools/` contains tool implementations for file editing, shell execution,
  MCP resources, task management, and agent delegation.
- `src/services/` contains runtime services for MCP, verification, memory,
  code indexing, model routing, background agents, A2A, analytics, sync, and
  API integration.
- `extensions/vscode-ur-inline-diffs/` contains the VS Code inline diff review
  extension.
- `marketplace-plugins/` contains bundled example marketplace plugins.

## Safety Model

UR can read files, edit code, execute commands, and call configured tools, so
the permission boundary matters.

- Sensitive tool actions go through permission checks by default.
- `--allowed-tools` and `--disallowed-tools` can scope tool access for
  automation.
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` should only be used inside disposable
  sandboxes.
- The verifier checks for false completion claims, repeated tool-call loops,
  empty assistant turns, and project gates.
- Project gates can be configured in `.ur/verify.json`.
- `ur test-first install` writes detected compile/test/lint commands into
  `.ur/verify.json` so mutating turns have command evidence before completion.
- The deep verification subagent is available through `/verify` and can be
  auto-enabled with `UR_VERIFIER_AUTO_SUBAGENT=1`.
- OS-level sandbox support is available on macOS and Linux through UR's
  sandbox settings.
- MCP servers can access external services; only enable servers you trust.

## Development

Install dependencies:

```sh
bun install
```

Run from source:

```sh
bun run start
bun run dev
```

Build and verify a release:

```sh
bun run typecheck
bun test
bun run bundle
bun run smoke
bun run secrets:scan
bun run release:check
npm pack --dry-run
```

`dist/cli.js` is intentionally tracked because GitHub installs use the bundled
CLI. Rebuild it after source, version, or macro changes.
