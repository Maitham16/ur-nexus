Use this folder to map important generated claims back to sources.

Recommended flow:

1. Capture WebFetch/WebSearch/MCP/file references as evidence items.
2. Attach each final-answer claim to one or more evidence refs.
3. Use \`/trace\`, \`/evidence\`, and the ledger schema here during audits.

UR can be dispatched from a GitHub issue/PR comment or a Slack mention.

1. Save the webhook payload to a file (your bot/CI does this).
2. Decide whether it should run:  \`ur trigger parse --file payload.json\`
3. Launch the agent for it:       \`ur trigger run --file payload.json\`

A run is triggered only when the configured keyword (default \`/ur\`) appears in
the comment/message; the text after the keyword becomes the prompt. Keep the
keyword and any allow-list of actors under your control — treat webhook content
as untrusted input.

The bundled GitHub Action (\`.github/workflows/ur.yml\`) is the outbound
runner; \`ur trigger\` is the inbound parser that decides what to run.
