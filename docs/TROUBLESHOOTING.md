# Troubleshooting

Each entry lists the symptom, the likely cause, the fix, and a command that
verifies the fix.

## Install and startup

### `ur: command not found`

- Likely cause: the package is not installed globally, or the npm/bun global
  bin directory is not on `PATH`.
- Fix: reinstall globally and check the global bin path.

```sh
npm install -g ur-agent
npm prefix -g       # ensure <prefix>/bin is on PATH
ur --version
```

### `npm install -g ur-agent` fails

- Likely cause: permission errors on the global prefix, or an old Node.js.
- Fix: use a user-writable npm prefix (or a Node version manager), then retry.

```sh
npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global   # then add ~/.npm-global/bin to PATH
npm install -g ur-agent
ur --version
```

### Bun is missing or too old

- Likely cause: UR is not Node-native. Every install path — npm, GitHub, and
  source checkouts — executes the CLI through Bun (this repository pins
  `bun@1.3.14`). The npm-installed `bin/ur.js` launcher starts under Node
  only to detect Bun and re-exec into it; if Bun is missing or too old, the
  launcher prints `UR-Nexus requires Bun ... at runtime` and exits instead of
  falling back to Node.
- Fix: install Bun, then rerun. Set `BUN_BIN` to an absolute Bun path if
  `bun` is installed but not on `PATH`.

```sh
npm install -g bun   # or: curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
bun --version
ur --version
```

### Invalid or corrupted settings

- Likely cause: malformed JSON in `~/.ur/settings.json` or project settings.
- Fix: repair the JSON or set values through safe config commands instead of
  editing by hand.

```sh
ur config set provider ollama
ur provider status
```

## Providers and models

### Provider selected but the model is unavailable

- Likely cause: the model was never pulled/served, or it belongs to a
  different provider.
- Fix: pick a model scoped to the active provider.

```sh
ur provider status
ur config set model <model-from-this-provider>   # or use /model in a session
```

### Selected model belongs to another provider

- Likely cause: provider was changed and the old model is incompatible; UR
  warns and clears the model in this case.
- Fix: choose a model from the current provider's list.

```sh
ur provider status
# then in a session: /model
```

### Requests appear to hit the wrong backend

- Likely cause: a stale provider/model pair.
- Fix: inspect the runtime backend; there is no cross-provider fallback, so
  the reported backend is the one receiving requests.

```sh
ur provider status
ur provider doctor
```

### Subscription CLI exits non-zero

- Likely cause: the vendor CLI (codex, claude, gemini, agy) is missing or not
  logged in.
- Fix: install the official CLI and log in.

```sh
ur provider doctor codex-cli    # or claude-code-cli, gemini-cli, antigravity-cli
ur auth chatgpt                 # or: ur auth claude | gemini | antigravity
```

### Provider produces output but exits with an error

- Likely cause: the vendor CLI wrote a partial result and then failed (quota,
  network, auth expiry). UR reports the provider, model, and backend with the
  failure instead of discarding the output silently.
- Fix: read the reported provider error, then re-check login/quota.

```sh
ur provider doctor <provider-id>
```

### Model discovery fails / model list is empty

- Likely cause: for local/server providers the endpoint is down; for API
  providers the key is missing, so only the curated fallback list shows.
- Fix: start the server or connect the key.

```sh
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags        # Ollama
curl http://localhost:1234/v1/models        # LM Studio (llama.cpp: 8080, vLLM: 8000)
ur connect openai-api                       # store an API key securely
ur provider doctor
```

### Local server unreachable

- Likely cause: wrong `base_url` or the server is not running.
- Fix: point UR at the right endpoint.

```sh
ur config set base_url http://localhost:11434
ur provider doctor
```

## Sessions and workflows

### No visible progress in scripts

- Likely cause: `ur -p` prints the final result only.
- Fix: stream structured progress.

```sh
ur -p --output-format stream-json "explain this repository"
```

### Dry-run works but the real run fails

- Likely cause: `--dry-run` skips model calls and permissions; the real run
  needs a reachable provider and permission approval.
- Fix: verify the provider, then run without `--dry-run` and approve prompts
  (or scope tools explicitly).

```sh
ur provider status
ur -p --allowed-tools "Read,Edit,Bash(git:*)" "run the task"
```

### Permission or sandbox issues

- Likely cause: the requested command is classified as write/execute/network
  and requires approval; OS sandbox dependencies (`sandbox-exec` on macOS,
  `bwrap` on Linux/WSL2) are missing; or `sandbox.failIfUnavailable` (required
  mode) is set and UR refused to start without a working sandbox.
- Fix: inspect the policy and the sandbox status; install missing sandbox
  dependencies, or relax `sandbox.enabled`/`sandbox.failIfUnavailable` in
  settings if required mode is not intended.

```sh
ur safety check --command "<the command>"
ur sandbox status
ur sandbox check
```

### Tests fail after an agent edit

- Likely cause: the edit broke a project gate.
- Fix: use the CI loop to repair with bounded attempts, or inspect verify
  gates.

```sh
ur ci-loop --command "bun test" --max-attempts 3
ur test-first detect
```

## Integrations

### Plugin fails to load

- Likely cause: invalid manifest or wrong install scope.
- Fix: validate the manifest and re-check installed state.

```sh
ur plugin doctor
ur plugin list
```

### ACP / editor connection issues

- Likely cause: the ACP server is not running, or the editor config block is
  missing.
- Fix: check status, regenerate the editor config, and run the IDE doctor.

```sh
ur acp status
ur ide doctor
ur ide config zed    # or vscode, cursor, windsurf, jetbrains, neovim
```
