# UR Agent code feature inventory

This file is a code-derived inventory of what this agent can do in the
`ur-agent` 1.18.0 source tree. It is meant to cover behavior that is easy to
miss in user-facing documentation.

Sources traced include:

- `package.json`
- `bin/ur.js`
- `src/entrypoints/cli.tsx`
- `src/main.tsx`
- `src/query.ts`
- `src/commands.ts`
- `src/tools.ts`
- `src/constants/prompts.ts`
- `src/tools/**`
- `src/commands/**`
- `src/services/**`
- `src/security/**`
- `src/utils/settings/**`
- `src/utils/plugins/**`
- `src/entrypoints/mcp.ts`
- `src/sdk/index.ts`
- `marketplace-plugins/**`

Notes:

- "Feature-gated" means the code exists but is conditional on env vars,
  feature flags, build type, user type, or settings.
- "Internal-only" means the code path is restricted to Anthropic/internal
  user types or similar checks in this tree.
- "Stub" means the source exposes a command/tool name but the implementation is
  intentionally disabled, null, or placeholder in this build.
- Copy-artifact files with names like `* 2.ts` are not treated as canonical;
  the cleanup pass removed the stale `escalate 2.ts` and `ollama 2.ts` copies.

## Package and binary entry

- Publishes the CLI as `ur` from `bin/ur.js`.
- Uses Bun as the runtime.
- Runs `dist/cli.js` when present, otherwise `src/entrypoints/cli.tsx` with
  build macros.
- Exposes package scripts for start, dev, bundling, release checks,
  typechecking, tests, smoke tests, secret scanning, package checks, and
  prepack bundling.
- Includes a dependency-free TypeScript SDK in `src/sdk/index.ts` that shells
  out to `ur -p --output-format json`.

## Startup and runtime modes

## Conversation loop features

- Maintains an assistant/user/tool message loop in `src/query.ts`.
- Streams assistant output and tool-use events.
- Executes tool calls through streaming and non-streaming orchestration.
- Supports parallel tool calls where the model emits them.
- Validates and repairs missing tool result blocks.
- Tracks tool-use summaries.
- Enforces turn limits and task budgets.
- Handles retryable API/model errors.
- Supports fallback models.
- Handles token-budget continuation.
- Applies tool result output budgets and content replacement.
- Supports large-output persistence and references.
- Performs auto-compaction and micro-compaction.
- Supports session-memory compaction.
- Supports post-compact cleanup.
- Has a disabled/stubbed context-collapse service in this build.
- Handles prompt-too-long recovery when feature-gated.
- Supports stop hooks and post-sampling hooks.
- Tracks verifier state and can inject reminders.
- Supports structured JSON output through a synthetic output tool.

## Prompt and behavioral system

The system prompt source in `src/constants/prompts.ts` includes:

- UR identity as a coding agent.
- Concise terminal-oriented output rules.
- Code editing expectations.
- Tool-use discipline and preference for file tools over shell ad hoc edits.
- Planning guidance for multi-step tasks.
- Guidance for using subagents.
- Guidance for invoking skills.
- Optional verification contract.
- Cyber-safety risk guidance.
- Hook instructions.
- MCP instructions.
- Memory instructions.
- Language and output-style customization.
- System reminders.
- Token-budget instructions.
- Brief/proactive sections.
- Scratchpad and function-result clearing sections.

For Ollama-backed providers, the prompt adds stricter instructions around:

- using structured tool calls rather than raw JSON/tool XML
- using `Write` and `Edit` for file changes
- preferring parallel tool calls
- planning before larger tasks
- stopping repeated failing calls
- verifying before claiming completion
- responding to command failures
- avoiding empty responses

`UR_CODE_SIMPLE` replaces this with a minimal prompt containing identity, cwd,
and date.

## Built-in tools

Tool assembly is centralized in `src/tools.ts`. Availability depends on mode,
feature flags, user type, MCP, and settings.

Core tools:

- `Bash`: run shell commands with permissions, sandbox checks, timeout,
  background execution, read-only auto-approval heuristics, destructive command
  warnings, output truncation/persistence, image output handling, git operation
  tracking, and UI collapsing for common read/search commands.
- `PowerShell`: PowerShell command execution with similar permission,
  path-safety, destructive-warning, and constrained-language checks.
- `Read`: read text files, selected line ranges, images, notebooks, and PDF
  page ranges; blocks binary or risky device paths; enforces size/token limits;
  tracks reads before edits.
- `Edit`: replace exact strings in files after prior read; validates paths,
  permissions, concurrent modifications, max file size, and secret exposure;
  records diffs/history.
- `Write`: create or overwrite files; requires prior read for existing files;
  validates permissions and unexpected modifications; records diffs/history.
- `NotebookEdit`: edit notebook cells.
- `Glob`: find files by glob pattern.
- `Grep`: search file contents with optimized ripgrep-backed behavior.
- `CodeSearch`: semantic code search through a local embedding index.
- `WebFetch`: fetch a URL and run a prompt over retrieved content.
- `WebSearch`: web search through the configured model/tool backend.
- `TodoWrite`: maintain conversation-local todo state.
- `Agent`: launch subagents synchronously or in the background; supports custom
  agents, built-in agents, plugin agents, MCP requirements, worktree isolation,
  remote mode, permission modes, cwd, background output files, teams, memory,
  and model overrides.
- `TaskOutput`: read background task output. Deprecated in favor of reading the
  output file directly.
- `TaskStop`: stop background tasks.
- `TaskCreate`, `TaskGet`, `TaskUpdate`, `TaskList`: task-list v2 tools for
  tracked work items, ownership, status, and blockers.
- `TeamCreate`, `TeamDelete`, `SendMessage`: multi-agent team coordination.
- `AskUserQuestion`: ask structured user questions from the agent loop.
- `EnterPlanMode` and `ExitPlanMode`: proposal/approval planning flow.
- `EnterWorktree` and `ExitWorktree`: enter or leave isolated worktree sessions.
- `Skill`: execute prompt-backed skills from local skills, bundled skills,
  plugins, or MCP.
- `Brief`: send concise status messages or user-facing updates.
- `SendUserFile`: send a generated file to the user, feature-gated.
- `ListMcpResourcesTool` and `ReadMcpResourceTool`: enumerate and read MCP
  resources.
- `ToolSearch`: deferred tool discovery over tool metadata.
- `Config`: read/write supported settings, internal-only in this build.
- `REPL`: internal REPL tooling.
- `Tungsten`: internal-only tooling.
- `SuggestBackgroundPR`: internal-only background PR suggestion.
- `LSP`: language-server diagnostics and symbol context, feature-gated.
- `WorkflowTool`: workflow execution helper, feature-gated.
- `CronCreate`, `CronDelete`, `CronList`: schedule recurring tasks,
  feature-gated.
- `RemoteTrigger`: trigger remote runs, feature-gated.
- `Monitor`: monitoring helper, feature-gated or stubbed depending on build.
- `Sleep`: wait/sleep tool.
- `PushNotification`: push notifications, feature-gated.
- `SubscribePR`: subscribe to PR changes, feature-gated/internal.
- `Snip`: snip tool, feature-gated/internal.
- `WebBrowserTool`, `CtxInspectTool`, `TerminalCaptureTool`: present as
  tool surfaces but stubbed or disabled in this build.
- `StructuredOutput`: synthetic tool used for JSON-schema output.
- `mcp__<server>__<tool>`: dynamically assembled MCP server tools.

Simple/bare mode keeps the tool set narrow, generally `Bash`, `Read`, and
`Edit`, with REPL mode substituting `REPL` where applicable.

## Built-in agents

Built-in agents live under `src/tools/AgentTool/built-in`:

- `general-purpose`: broad-purpose subagent with all tools.
- `Explore`: read/search-only exploration agent, no file writes.
- `plan`: planning agent for implementation designs, no file writes.
- `verification`: adversarial verification agent for checking tests, builds,
  browser behavior, and task completion.
- `statusline-setup`: statusline configuration agent with read/edit tools.
- `urCodeGuide`: UR documentation and guide agent with read/search/web tools.

Custom agents can be loaded from user, project, managed, flag, or plugin
sources. Agent definitions can configure:

- description
- tool allowlist
- disallowed tools
- prompt
- model
- effort
- permission mode
- required MCP servers
- hooks
- max turns
- skills
- initial prompt
- memory
- background behavior
- isolation mode

Agent resolution considers built-ins, plugins, user settings, project settings,
CLI-provided agents, and managed settings.

## Model/provider behavior

- This external build routes model calls through an Ollama provider shim.
- The Ollama router inspects local models and classifies likely coding/fast
  capabilities.
- Auto-routing is on by default through `UR_OLLAMA_AUTO_ROUTE`.
- Simple prompts can route to a faster model.
- Complex coding prompts can route to the best available coder model.
- Model doctor and model route commands expose capability reports and
  recommendations.
- Embedding-backed features use local Ollama embeddings such as
  `nomic-embed-text` where configured.

## UI and terminal experience

Terminal/UI features include:

- Ink/React interactive UI.
- Theming and color controls.
- Vim mode.
- Status line configuration.
- Keybinding help.
- Cost and usage displays.
- Session browser and resume UI.
- Compacting UI.
- Permission prompts.
- MCP approval UI.
- Plugin management UI.
- Install/setup flows.
- Feedback and BTW commands.
- Terminal setup.
- Desktop, Chrome, IDE, remote environment, and OS integration commands.
- Voice command surface, feature-gated.
- Image/video/youtube command surfaces.

## SDK and embedding

`src/sdk/index.ts` exposes:

- `query`
- `queryJSON`
- `UrClient`
- `parseResultText`

The SDK is intentionally small and dependency-free. It shells out to the local
`ur` binary in print mode, uses JSON output, supports cwd/env/bin overrides, and
can pass max turns, model, permission mode, and extra args.

## Documentation gaps this inventory exposes

The code includes many features that are easy to miss if reading only user docs:

- Agent-platform workflows, goals, specs, crews, arena, CI loop, artifacts,
  triggers, evals, and learning.
- A2A card/server/token support.
- Rich hook event model.
- Plugin marketplace and bundled plugin system.
- Security audit, incident-response, compliance, and lab features.
- Local knowledge, semantic memory, project DNA, and code-index subsystems.
- Verifier and project gate logic.
- Multiple remote/background/daemon/server modes.
- MCP server mode that exposes UR tools to other clients.
- Feature-gated browser, Chrome, computer-use, voice, push, cron, and remote
  features.
