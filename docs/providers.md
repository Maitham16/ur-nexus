# UR-Nexus providers

UR-Nexus integrates official model access paths only. API-key providers, local
runtimes, and OpenAI-compatible servers are UR-native backends: UR owns the
conversation loop, native tool-call parsing, streaming, errors, and UR-run tool
execution. Subscription CLI providers (Codex CLI, Claude Code, Gemini CLI,
Antigravity) are external app bridges: they are first-class in `/model` and
dispatch each turn through the vendor's official CLI using your subscription
login. They are optional, never required dependencies, and never used as a
silent fallback.

## Legal auth policy

UR-Nexus never:

- scrapes browser cookies or browser sessions
- extracts, copies, or reuses OAuth refresh tokens
- reads hidden provider auth files directly
- bypasses subscription, quota, region, product, or organization restrictions
- proxies a consumer web session as an API
- claims provider support unless the official CLI/API path works

UR-Nexus stores only safe config: provider name, model name, base URL, fallback
preference, and non-secret preferences. API keys are read from environment
variables only when the user explicitly selects API mode.

## Provider matrix

Concise capability matrix — provider kind, native tool calls, native streaming,
multimodal input, external CLI boundary, and sandbox scope:

| Provider | Access type | Provider kind | External CLI | Native tools | Native streaming | Multimodal input | Sandbox scope | Runtime backend | Legal path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Subscription | subscription | subscription-placeholder | no | no | no | n/a | n/a (no runtime) | `subscription:unconfigured` | independent subscription runtime only |
| OpenAI API | API | UR-native | no | yes | yes | yes | UR Bash/File sandbox | `api:openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Claude API | API | UR-native | no | yes | yes | yes | UR Bash/File sandbox | `api:anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| Gemini API | API | UR-native | no | yes | yes | yes | UR Bash/File sandbox | `api:gemini` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| OpenRouter | API/router | UR-native | no | yes | yes | yes | UR Bash/File sandbox | `api:openrouter` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| Ollama | local | UR-native | no | yes | yes | yes* | UR Bash/File sandbox | `ollama` | localhost Ollama runtime |
| LM Studio | local/server | UR-native | no | yes | yes | yes | UR Bash/File sandbox | `openai-compatible:lmstudio` | local OpenAI-compatible server |
| llama.cpp | local/server | UR-native | no | yes | yes | yes | UR Bash/File sandbox | `openai-compatible:llama.cpp` | local OpenAI-compatible server |
| vLLM | local/server | UR-native | no | yes | yes | yes | UR Bash/File sandbox | `openai-compatible:vllm` | OpenAI-compatible server |
| Codex CLI | subscription | subscription-cli | yes | no | no | no† | UR-run tools/output only† | `subscription-cli:codex` | official Codex CLI login |
| Claude Code | subscription | subscription-cli | yes | no | no | no† | UR-run tools/output only† | `subscription-cli:claude-code` | official Claude Code CLI login |
| Gemini CLI | subscription | subscription-cli | yes | no | no | no† | UR-run tools/output only† | `subscription-cli:gemini` | official Gemini Code Assist login |
| Antigravity | subscription | subscription-cli | yes | no | no | no† | UR-run tools/output only† | `subscription-cli:antigravity` | official Antigravity CLI login, where supported |

\* Ollama forwards images only to models that advertise vision support;
unsupported models get a text placeholder instead of the image.

† External vendor CLI boundary (see below): UR passes prompt text only to the
official CLI, so image blocks are not forwarded, and UR-native tool/streaming/
sandbox guarantees stop at UR-run tools and final UR output.

Native tools and native streaming mean UR's own request/response loop parses
tool calls and streams tokens for that provider. Multimodal input means UR
preserves image content blocks (resized/normalized with `sharp`) into that
provider's wire format instead of stripping them. Sandbox scope states what
UR's OS-level sandbox (macOS `sandbox-exec`, Linux `bwrap`) actually covers
for that provider — see [Sandbox](CONFIGURATION.md#sandbox) for mode
details.

## Runtime boundary

UR-native providers use UR's provider adapters and tool loop. For those
providers, UR owns request shaping (including multimodal image-block mapping),
native tool-call parsing, native streaming, and the UR-run Bash/File tool
permission, sandbox, and verifier flow.

Subscription CLI providers use a different boundary:

> External vendor CLI boundary: UR passes prompt text to the official CLI and
> receives final text output. UR-native tool calling, UR Bash/File tool
> execution, UR-native streaming, local command permissions, sandbox guarantees,
> and verifier/done-gate checks apply to UR-run tools/final UR output, not to
> actions the external CLI performs internally.

That means the external CLI may have its own tool use, streaming, filesystem
access, network access, permissions, and safety behavior. UR reports CLI
failures as provider-scoped errors and does not fabricate assistant text or
silently switch to another provider.

## Commands

```sh
ur provider list
ur provider status
ur provider doctor
ur provider doctor codex-cli
ur provider doctor agy
ur provider models [provider] --json
# Subscription CLI logins (official vendor CLIs):
ur auth chatgpt
ur auth claude
ur auth gemini
ur auth antigravity
ur config set provider ollama
ur config set provider openai-api
ur config set provider anthropic-api
ur config set provider gemini-api
ur config set provider openrouter
ur config set provider openai-compatible
ur config set model <model>
ur provider select-model <provider> <model> --json
ur config set base_url <url>
ur config set provider.fallback ollama
```

## Provider-scoped model selection

UR-Nexus shows providers first, then only models available for the selected provider. This prevents incompatible model/provider pairs and keeps API-key, local/server, subscription, and external app bridge model lists separate. The generic `subscription` entry has no models unless a real independent subscription runtime is configured; UR does not list fake subscription models.

## Runtime provider routing

When you select a UR-native provider and model, every agent request is routed
through that provider's backend:

- **API providers** make direct HTTP calls in each provider's native wire format: Anthropic uses `x-api-key` + `anthropic-version` against `/v1/messages`; OpenAI uses `Authorization: Bearer` against `/v1/chat/completions`; Gemini uses `x-goog-api-key` against `…:generateContent`; OpenRouter uses its OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint.
- **Local/server providers** connect to the configured local or OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`/v1/chat/completions` for LM Studio, llama.cpp and vLLM; the native tags/chat API for Ollama)
- **Subscription CLI providers** (Codex CLI, Claude Code, Gemini CLI,
  Antigravity) dispatch the turn through the vendor's official CLI using your
  subscription login. They do not use UR-native tool calling, UR-native
  streaming, or UR Bash/File tool execution inside the external CLI. Failures
  remain provider-scoped and never fall back to Ollama or any other provider.
- The generic **`subscription`** entry is an internal placeholder with no
  models and no backend; it is hidden from listings. Choose a specific
  subscription CLI, API, or local/server provider instead.

The selected provider determines:
- Which backend receives your requests
- Which models are available
- How authentication works
- What error messages you see

**Important:** Ollama is only used when `ollama` is the selected provider.
Selecting another provider routes requests through that provider's backend. If
runtime dispatch fails, UR reports the selected provider, selected model, and
runtime backend instead of switching to Ollama.

### `/model` command flow

When you run `/model` in the interactive agent, you get a **two-step provider-first selection**:

**Step 1: Provider Selection**

You see all configured providers with:
- Provider name (e.g., "Codex CLI", "OpenAI API", "Ollama")
- Access type: `subscription`, `api`, `local`, or `server`
- Connection status: `connected`, `missing`, `unavailable`, or `unknown`
- Credential type: `cli-login`, `api-key`, `local-runtime`, or `openai-compatible-endpoint`
- Short status message (e.g., "OPENAI_API_KEY found", "CLI not found", "localhost reachable")
- Runtime kind: `UR-native` or `external app bridge`
- Provider kind and boundary: `ur-native`, `subscription-cli`, or
  `subscription-placeholder`

**Step 2: Model Selection**

After selecting a provider:
- Only models from that provider are shown
- Each model shows its description
- Model source is displayed: `live` (dynamic discovery), `cache` (fallback), or `static` (predefined)
- Press Esc to go back and change provider

**Confirmation**

After selecting a model, the confirmation shows:
- Selected provider and access type
- Selected model name
- Model source (live/cache/static)
- Runtime backend
- Provider status and doctor output also show provider kind, whether an
  external CLI is used, whether UR-native tool calls/streaming are supported,
  and the exact safety boundary.
- Effort level (if applicable)
- Thinking status (if enabled)

**Example:**
```
/model
→ Step 1: Select provider
  Ollama · local · local-runtime · localhost reachable
  OpenAI API · api · OPENAI_API_KEY found
  
→ Select: Ollama

→ Step 2: Select model
  llama3 · discovered from Ollama · live
  qwen3-coder:480b-cloud · discovered from Ollama · live
  
→ Select: llama3

→ Confirmation:
  Selected provider: Ollama (local)
  Selected model: llama3
  Model source: live
  Runtime backend: ollama
```

### CLI workflow

```sh
# 1. Select a provider
ur config set provider openai-api

# 2. View available models for that provider (in model picker)
/model

# 3. Select a model from the filtered list
ur config set model gpt-5.5

# 4. Switch to a different provider - model list updates automatically
ur config set provider anthropic-api
# Now /model shows only Claude API models, not OpenAI API or Ollama models
```

### Model discovery behavior

| Provider type | Model discovery | Source label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API providers (openai-api, anthropic-api, gemini-api, openrouter) | Live discovery from the provider's `/models` endpoint using your connected key (curated fallback until connected) | live |
| Local/server providers (ollama, lmstudio, llama.cpp, vllm) | Dynamic discovery from the selected provider endpoint | live |
| OpenAI-compatible | Dynamic discovery from configured endpoint | live |
| Subscription CLIs (codex-cli, claude-code-cli, gemini-cli, antigravity-cli) | Curated list (the official CLIs expose no models API); first-class in `/model`, dispatched via the official CLI. External CLI behavior depends on the vendor CLI. Log in with `ur auth <provider>` | static |

### API vs Subscription distinction

**Subscription CLI providers** require the vendor's official CLI login:
- `codex-cli` — Codex CLI subscription via `codex login`
- `claude-code-cli` — Claude Code subscription via `claude auth login`
- `gemini-cli` — Gemini Code Assist enterprise login
- `antigravity-cli` — Antigravity subscription login

**API providers** require environment variable with API key:
- `openai-api` — requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `anthropic-api` — requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `gemini-api` — requires `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `openrouter` — requires `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

**Local/server providers** require local runtime or endpoint:
- `ollama` — localhost Ollama server
- `lmstudio` — LM Studio OpenAI-compatible server
- `llama.cpp` — llama.cpp server mode
- `vllm` — vLLM server

**Important:**
- A ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini subscription does NOT give API access
- An API key does NOT give subscription CLI access
- UR does not require Codex CLI, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or Antigravity to use
  API, Ollama, or OpenAI-compatible providers
- OpenAI API and Codex CLI are separate providers
- Claude API and Claude Code are separate providers
- Gemini API and Gemini CLI are separate providers

### Connecting accounts (`ur connect` / `/connect`)

Connect a provider once from inside UR (or a terminal). The connection persists,
so you do not repeat it each session:

```sh
ur connect status                      # connection state for every provider
ur connect codex-cli                   # subscription: launches the official login (Codex/Claude/Gemini)
echo "$OPENAI_API_KEY" | ur connect openai-api   # API: store a key (from stdin, not shell history)
ur connect openai-api --key <KEY>      # API: store a key explicitly
ur connect logout openai-api           # clear a stored key
```

- **Subscription providers** (`codex-cli`, `claude-code-cli`, `gemini-cli`,
  `antigravity-cli`) connect through their official CLI login using your own
  account; the session is persisted by that CLI. UR never scrapes or copies
  those tokens. UR-native tools, sandbox guarantees, local command permissions,
  and verifier/done-gate checks apply to UR-run tools/final UR output, not to
  internal actions performed by the external CLI.
- **API providers** (`openai-api`, `anthropic-api`, `gemini-api`, `openrouter`)
  store the key in your OS keychain (macOS Keychain, with an encrypted file
  fallback) — the same secure store UR uses for its own credentials. At runtime
  a stored key is used first, then the provider's environment variable, so
  setting the env var still works and never gets overwritten.

If you select a provider that is not connected, UR shows a connect prompt in
`/model` and the runtime fails clearly with the exact `ur connect <provider>`
command instead of silently switching providers.

### Validation

When you set a model that is incompatible with the current provider, UR-Nexus shows an error:

```
Invalid model for current provider:
  Selected provider: openai-api
  Selected model: claude-sonnet-5
  Valid models for openai-api: gpt-5.5, gpt-5.4, gpt-5.4-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, o1, o3-mini
  Suggested action: Run /model and choose a model from openai-api, or run: ur config set model gpt-5.5
  Error: Model "claude-sonnet-5" is not available for provider "openai-api".
```

When you change providers, UR-Nexus warns if the current model is incompatible:

```
Warning: Current model "gpt-5.5" is not available for provider "anthropic-api" and will be cleared.
  Valid models for anthropic-api: claude-sonnet-5, claude-opus-4-8, claude-opus-4-7
  After changing provider, run /model or: ur config set model claude-sonnet-5
```

For subscription CLI providers, UR stores provider-scoped model IDs such as
`claude-code/sonnet`, and runtime dispatch validates the pair against the
provider's curated list before spawning the official CLI.

### Troubleshooting

**Check active provider and model:**
```sh
# Show selected provider, model, access type, credential, readiness, and backend
ur provider status
```

**Subscription CLI provider is not working:**
- Run `ur provider doctor <provider>` to check CLI presence and login status
- Install the vendor's official CLI if it is missing, then log in with
  `ur auth <chatgpt|claude|gemini|antigravity>`
- Remember these run through the external vendor CLI; UR-native tool calls,
  UR-native streaming, Bash/File tool semantics, sandbox guarantees, and local
  command permissions do not apply to what the external CLI does internally

**Provider shows "unavailable":**
- Check API key: `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Check local server: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`
- Run: `ur provider doctor <provider>` for detailed diagnostics

**Model not in list:**
- Verify provider is correct: `/provider`
- Check model belongs to provider (API models ≠ CLI models)
- For local providers, ensure server is running and model is pulled

**Requests going to wrong backend:**
- Verify selected provider and runtime backend: `ur provider status`
- Change provider: `ur config set provider <provider-id>`
- Choose a scoped model: `/model`
- The selected provider determines which backend receives requests
- Ollama is only used when `ollama` is the selected provider
- Runtime dispatch validates the provider/model pair before sending a request

**Dynamic discovery fails:**
- Local/server providers: check server is running at configured URL
- OpenAI-compatible: verify base_url and API key (if required)
- Fallback only to same provider's cached models (never other providers)

**Saved local/server model rejected after restart:**
- A model saved via `/model` for a live-discovery provider (`ollama`, `lmstudio`, `llama.cpp`, `vllm`, `openai-compatible`) is accepted on a fresh process even before discovery has repopulated the in-memory model cache. The endpoint is the source of truth, so a saved model is not rejected pre-discovery. Static providers (API/subscription) remain strictly validated against their model list.

**Debug active runtime backend:**
```sh
ur provider status
```

`ur provider doctor` adds detailed diagnostics for the same selected provider.

Provider config and doctor commands accept canonical IDs and common aliases:

| Canonical ID | Accepted examples |
| --- | --- |
| `codex-cli` | `chatgpt`, `codex`, `openai codex` |
| `claude-code-cli` | `claude`, `Claude Code`, `anthropic claude` |
| `gemini-cli` | `gemini`, `gemini cli`, `gemini code assist` |
| `antigravity-cli` | `antigravity`, `agy`, `ag`, `google antigravity` |
| `openai-api` | `openai`, `openai api` |
| `anthropic-api` | `anthropic`, `claude api` |
| `gemini-api` | `gemini api`, `google gemini api` |
| `openrouter` | `openrouter api` |
| `openai-compatible` | `compatible`, `openai compatible` |
| `ollama` | `ollama local` |
| `lmstudio` | `LM Studio`, `lm-studio` |
| `llama.cpp` | `llama cpp`, `llamacpp`, `llama-cpp` |
| `vllm` | `vllm server` |

`ur provider doctor` checks the selected provider. It reports installed/missing
CLIs, official login status where available, API key presence for API providers,
local endpoint reachability, detectable model availability, unsupported account
type signals, and fallback configuration.

Fallback is never silent by default. If the selected provider fails, UR-Nexus
reports the selected provider, failure reason, suggested fix, and configured
fallback option.

## Subscription CLI providers

- `codex-cli`: detects `codex --version`, uses `codex login` or
  `codex login --device-auth`, and checks `codex login status`.
- `claude-code-cli`: detects `claude --version`, uses `claude auth login`, and
  checks `claude auth status` when available. If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set,
  doctor warns that API-key mode may override subscription auth.
- `gemini-cli`: launches only the official Gemini CLI flow. If the detected
  path is an unsupported personal-account path, UR-Nexus prints a clear error.
- `antigravity-cli`: detects official CLI commands including `agy --version`,
  `antigravity --version`, `google-antigravity --version`, or `ag --version`
  where installed. It launches only an installed official CLI command where
  supported; UR-Nexus does not invent flags.

## API and local/server providers

API providers require explicit user selection and environment keys:

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
```

OpenAI-compatible endpoints can point at local or cloud endpoints:

```sh
ur config set provider openai-compatible
ur config set base_url http://localhost:1234/v1
ur config set model local-model-name
```

Local/server providers use their normal endpoints:

- Ollama: `http://localhost:11434`
- LM Studio: `http://localhost:1234/v1`
- llama.cpp server mode: `http://localhost:8080/v1`
- vLLM server mode: `http://localhost:8000/v1`

## Optional Live Provider Smoke

`bun run provider:smoke` runs optional live checks only for providers with the
required environment variables present. With no variables set it exits
successfully and reports every provider as skipped, so CI does not need secrets.

Configured providers run one short text request, a finite-timeout streaming
request, and, when `PROVIDER_SMOKE_TOOL_CALLS=1`, a forced tool-call request.

Required variables:

| Provider | Required env vars | Optional env vars |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI-compatible | `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL` | `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` |
| OpenRouter | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_MODEL` |  |
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` |
| Gemini | `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_MODEL` | `GEMINI_BASE_URL` |
| Ollama | `OLLAMA_MODEL` | `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` or `OLLAMA_HOST` |
| LM Studio | `LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL`, `LMSTUDIO_MODEL` | `LMSTUDIO_API_KEY` |
| vLLM | `VLLM_BASE_URL`, `VLLM_MODEL` | `VLLM_API_KEY` |

Common knobs:

```sh
PROVIDER_SMOKE_TIMEOUT_MS=30000
PROVIDER_SMOKE_MAX_RETRIES=0
PROVIDER_SMOKE_TOOL_CALLS=1
```
