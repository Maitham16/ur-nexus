# Configuration

UR reads configuration from CLI flags, environment variables, and project or user settings files.

## Model Providers

UR-AGENT supports official provider access paths only:

- Subscription/login CLI providers: Codex CLI, Claude Code CLI, Gemini CLI,
  and Antigravity CLI where officially supported.
- Explicit API providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter, and
  OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- Local providers: Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, and vLLM OpenAI-compatible
  server mode.

UR-AGENT never scrapes browser sessions, extracts OAuth refresh tokens, reads
hidden provider auth files, bypasses provider restrictions, or proxies consumer
web sessions as APIs.

The default local request endpoint is:

```text
http://localhost:11434/api
```

Any model exposed by that Ollama app can be used, including local models and
Ollama Cloud-backed models. Explicit API providers may call their configured
API endpoints, but UR does not store model API keys in settings.

Provider configuration commands:

```sh
ur provider list
ur provider doctor
ur provider status
ur auth chatgpt
ur auth claude
ur auth gemini
ur auth antigravity
ur config set provider ollama
ur config set provider claude
ur config set provider "Claude Code"
ur config set provider antigravity
ur provider doctor agy
ur config set provider openai-compatible
ur config set provider.fallback ollama
ur config set model <model>
ur config set base_url <url>
```

Provider values accept canonical IDs and common aliases. Examples:
`codex-cli`, `chatgpt`, `codex`, `claude-code-cli`, `claude`,
`Claude Code`, `gemini-cli`, `gemini`, `antigravity-cli`, `antigravity`,
`agy`, `ollama`, `lmstudio`, `LM Studio`, `llama.cpp`, and `vllm`.
Values with spaces should be quoted in shell commands.

API keys are not written to UR settings. Set them in the environment when you
explicitly choose API mode:

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
```

### Reconfiguring the Ollama host

The endpoint can be changed from UR in three ways, in order of precedence:

1. `--ollama-host <url>` CLI flag (session only)
2. `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable
3. `ollama.host` in user settings (`~/.ur/settings.json`)

Examples:

```sh
# Session-only
ur --ollama-host http://192.168.1.50:11434

# Via environment
OLLAMA_HOST=http://192.168.1.50:11434 ur

# Persistent setting
ur --settings '{"ollama":{"host":"http://192.168.1.50:11434"}}'
```

Model selection environment variables still work the same way:

```sh
OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen3-coder:480b-cloud
UR_MODEL=qwen3-coder:480b-cloud
```

`OLLAMA_MODEL` selects the model name and takes precedence over `UR_MODEL`. If neither is set, UR lets its Ollama router choose from the model list advertised by the configured Ollama app. If that discovery fails, the built-in fallback is `qwen3-coder:480b-cloud`.

### Discovering LAN Ollama servers

UR can scan your active local subnets for other Ollama servers and show a picker. This works for both wired Ethernet and wireless (Wi-Fi/WLAN) interfaces:

```sh
ur --discover-ollama
```

This is **session-only**: the picker appears and the chosen host is used for
that session, but plain `ur` continues to use `localhost:11434` unless you set
`ollama.host` explicitly.

To make the picker appear on every startup, enable it in user settings:

```json
{
  "ollama": {
    "lanDiscovery": true
  }
}
```

The scan is limited to active local IPv4 interfaces, ignores loopback/link-local
addresses, and uses bounded concurrency with short timeouts. It is opt-in and
never runs automatically unless enabled.

## CLI Flags

Frequently used flags:

```sh
ur --model <model>
ur --settings <file-or-json>
ur --add-dir <path>
ur --mcp-config <file-or-json>
ur --permission-mode <mode>
ur --plugin-dir <path>
ur --agents '<json>'
```

Use `ur --help` for the complete list.

## Settings Files

UR supports user, project, and local settings. Project-shared settings can live under `.ur/`, while local files should remain private.

Recommended Git behavior:

- Commit shared docs, skills, agents, and project settings that are safe for teammates.
- Do not commit `.ur/settings.local.json`.
- Do not commit generated `.ur/index/`, `.ur/memory/`, `.ur/cache/`, `.ur/tmp/`, or `.ur/logs/`.
- Do not commit `UR.local.md`.

## Verifier

UR runs a lightweight verifier in the agent loop (L1) to catch false "task
done" claims, infinite tool-call loops, empty assistant turns, and project
gate failures. This is the cheap "try the implementation" pass and always
runs (outside `mode=off`).

The heavy independent `verification` subagent (L2) is **opt-in**: by default
UR never auto-spawns it after a turn. Trigger that deep second opinion
yourself with the `/verify` command when you want it. Set
`UR_VERIFIER_AUTO_SUBAGENT=1` to restore the old behaviour where the verifier
nudges the model to spawn the subagent after every mutating turn.

Behaviour is controlled by environment variables:

```sh
# Overall mode (default: strict) — controls the L1 gates
UR_VERIFIER_MODE=strict   # all L1 gates on: done-claim, loops, empty turn,
                          # project gates
UR_VERIFIER_MODE=loose    # only empty-turn check + loop detector
UR_VERIFIER_MODE=off      # disable verifier entirely

# L2 deep-verification subagent (default: off — run it manually via /verify)
UR_VERIFIER_AUTO_SUBAGENT=1      # auto-nudge the subagent after every
                                 # mutating turn (the old default)
UR_VERIFIER_DISABLE_SUBAGENT=1   # hard-off: also unregister the verification
                                 # agent so /verify can't spawn it either
```

Project-specific gates live in `.ur/verify.json`:

```json
{
  "afterEdit": ["bun x tsc --noEmit", "bun test --quiet"],
  "afterBash": [],
  "ignorePatterns": ["**/*.md", "node_modules/**"],
  "timeoutMs": 60000
}
```

Run `ur test-first install` to detect the current project stack and merge the
compile/test/lint commands it finds into `afterEdit`.

After a turn that modified files, every `afterEdit` command must exit 0
before the agent can declare the task complete. A failing command surfaces
to the model as a structured reminder with the command name and the trimmed
stdout/stderr.

## Project Safety Policy

`ur safety` exposes the project shell safety policy:

```sh
ur safety status
ur safety init
ur safety check --command "rm -rf build"
```

The default policy separates command behavior into read, write, execute, and
network permission classes. It asks before destructive operations, recommends
sandboxing for write/execute/network commands, and denies common secret-file or
secret-like environment exfiltration patterns before broad Bash allow rules.

Run `ur safety init` to write `.ur/safety-policy.json`. Commit it only when the
rules are safe and useful for the whole team; keep machine-local secrets and
local settings out of Git.

## Project Context Pack

`ur context-pack` writes durable architecture context and task memory:

```sh
ur context-pack scan
ur context-pack remember --decision "Use package scripts before ad hoc commands"
ur context-pack remember --constraint "Do not expose secret values"
ur context-pack remember --command "bun run typecheck"
ur context-pack remember --diff "Safety policy wired into Bash permission checks"
ur context-pack compress
```

Generated files:

- `.ur/project-manifest.json` — architecture manifest from Project DNA,
  package scripts, instruction files, Cursor-style rules, `.ur/verify.json`,
  `.ur/safety-policy.json`, MCP config, editor settings, workflow files, and
  other manifests.
- `.ur/context/architecture.md` — human-readable architecture summary.
- `.ur/context/task-memory.jsonl` — decisions, constraints, commands, diffs,
  and notes.
- `.ur/context/compressed.md` — compressed task context summary.

Two related slash commands:

- `/verify [focus]` — manually run the deep verification subagent (e.g.
  `/verify the auth flow`). This is the primary way to trigger L2; useful
  before a commit.
- `/trace [n]` — print a structured view of the last `n` messages (default 8,
  max 50): roles, tool calls, tool results, verifier verdicts. Useful for
  debugging what the agent did during a turn.

## MCP Servers

Use the `mcp` subcommand to manage Model Context Protocol servers:

```sh
ur mcp list
ur mcp get <name>
ur mcp add-json <name> '<json>'
ur mcp remove <name>
```

MCP servers may execute code or access external services. Only enable servers you trust, and keep credentials out of committed config.

## Plugins and Skills

Plugins can add commands, tools, and skills:

```sh
ur plugin list
ur plugin install <plugin>
ur plugin update <plugin>
ur plugin disable <plugin>
```

Skills can be stored in `.ur/skills/` for project-specific workflows or in `~/.ur/skills/` for personal workflows.

## Secrets

Keep secrets in environment variables, local settings, a secret manager, or your shell profile. Never commit API keys, OAuth tokens, private keys, service-account JSON, or `.env` files.
